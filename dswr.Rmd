# Hypothesis validation

```{r}
# Read data_cleaned
df_cleaned <- readRDS("df_cleaned.rds")
```

## **H1) Customers with HIGHER AGE are more likely to be interested in the car insurance. ✅**

```{r}
# Boxplot
age_boxplot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = age)) +
  stat_boxplot(geom = 'errorbar', width = 0.6) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = response), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Age vs. Response Comparison", y = "Age", x = "Response") +
  theme_bw()
 
ggsave("age_boxplot.jpg", plot = age_boxplot, width = 6, 
       height = 4) 



# Histogram 
age_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "gray", fill="navy") +
  facet_wrap(vars(response), nrow = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(y = "Number of clients") + 
  ggtitle("Age distribution")

age_plot

ggsave("age_plot.jpg", plot = age_plot, width = 6, 
       height = 4) 
```

```{r}
# Descriptive Statistics
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(age, response) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

Young people seems to be less interested in the car insurance. The median age for intereseted customers is 43 years (IQR: 35, 51), while the median for non-interested customers is 34 years (IQR: 24, 49).

## **H2) Women are likely to be interested in the car insurance.** ❌

```{r}
gender_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, gender) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = gender), position = 'dodge') +
  labs(title = "Gender vs. Response", 
       x = "Response", y = "Number of customers") +
  theme_bw()

ggsave("gender_plot.png", plot = gender_plot)
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, gender) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

For customers interested in the car insurance, 61% were men, and 39% were women. So, this hypothesis is FALSE. Although, gender and response are statistically significant, i. e., are related.

## **H3) Customers having newer cars are more likely to be interested in the car insurance.** ❌

```{r}
car_age_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, vehicle_age) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = vehicle_age), position = 'dodge') +
  labs(title = "Vehicle Age vs. Response", 
       x = "Response", y = "Number of customers") +
  theme_bw()

ggsave("car_age_plot.jpg", plot = car_age_plot)
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, vehicle_age) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

Customers with cars aged between 1 and 2 years are more likely to be interested in the car insurance (75%). While, only 15% of the interested customers have newer cars.

## **H4)** Customers with previous car damage are more likely to accept the car insurance ✅

```{r}
car_damage_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, vehicle_damage) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = vehicle_damage), position = 'dodge') +
  labs(title = "Vehicle Damage vs. Response", 
       x = "Response", y = "Number of customers") +
  theme_bw()

car_damage_plot

ggsave("car_damage_plot.jpg", plot = car_damage_plot)
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, vehicle_damage) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

Customers with previous car damage are likely to be interested in the car insurance, as 98% said yes.

## **H5)** Customers with previous car insurance are more likely to accept the car insurance ❌

```{r}
car_insurance_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, previously_insured) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = previously_insured), position = 'dodge') +
  labs(title = "Vehicle Previously Insured vs. Response", 
       x = "Response", y = "Number of customers") +
  theme_bw()
car_insurance_plot
ggsave("car_insurance_plot.jpg", plot = car_insurance_plot)
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, previously_insured) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

Only 0.3% of customers interested in the car insurance have the car previously insured.

## **H6) Interest is greater in customers with HIGHER ANNUAL HEALTH expenses.** ❌

```{r}
# Boxplot
expenses_boxplot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = health_annual_paid)) +
  stat_boxplot(geom = 'errorbar', width = 0.6) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = response), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Annual Payment vs. Response Comparison", 
       y = "Annual Payment", x = "Response") +
  theme_bw()
 
ggsave("expenses_boxplot.jpg", 
       plot = expenses_boxplot, width = 6, 
       height = 4) 

# Histogram 
expenses_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = health_annual_paid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000, color = "gray", fill="navy") +
  facet_wrap(vars(response), nrow = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(y = "Number of clients") + 
  ggtitle("Expenses distribution")

expenses_plot

ggsave("expenses_plot.jpg", plot = expenses_plot, 
       width = 6, 
       height = 4) 
```

```{r}
# Descriptive Statistics
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, health_annual_paid) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

Although the health annual paid showed to be significant, we consider this hypotheses FALSE, and will further investigate the outliers.

## **H7) Customers with health insurance for MORE TIME are more likely to be interested in car insurance** ❌

```{r}
# Boxplot
days_boxplot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = days_associated)) +
  stat_boxplot(geom = 'errorbar', width = 0.6) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = response), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Days associated vs. Response Comparison", 
       y = "Days", x = "Response") +
  theme_bw()
 
ggsave("days_boxplot.jpg", 
       plot = days_boxplot, width = 6, 
       height = 4) 

# Histogram 
days_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = days_associated)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 30, color = "gray", fill="navy") +
  facet_wrap(vars(response), nrow = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(y = "Number of clients") + 
  ggtitle("Days associated distribution")

days_plot

ggsave("days_plot.jpg", plot = days_plot, 
       width = 6, 
       height = 4) 
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, days_associated) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

This hypothesis is FALSE, basically the interested customers and non-interested customers have the same amount of days associated. Yes (median: 154 days, IQR: 82, 226); No (154 days, IQR: 82, 227).

## Hypothesis conclusion

```{r}
hypothesis <- c(
  "H1) Customers with HIGHER AGE are more likely to be interested in the car insurance.",

There is no strong correlation among numerical variables.

# Data Preparation

-   **Frequency** encoding for `policy_sales_channel` \| ***Build Function ✅***

-   **Target encoding** for `gender` e `region_code` \| ***Build Function ✅***

## Target encoding

```{r}
# For gender
gender_encoder <- df_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(response_num = ifelse(response == "yes", 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(gender_num = mean(response_num, na.rm = TRUE))
  
# For region_code  
region_encoder <- df_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(response_num = ifelse(response == "yes", 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(region_code) %>% 
  summarise(region_num = mean(response_num, na.rm = TRUE))

# Save in rds
saveRDS(gender_encoder, "gender_encoder.rds")
saveRDS(region_encoder, "region_encoder.rds")
```

## **Frequency encoding**

```{r}
policy_encoder <- df_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(policy_sales_channel) %>% 
  summarise(policy_num = n()/nrow(df_cleaned))

# Save in rds
saveRDS(policy_encoder, "policy_encoder.rds")
```

-   Using the created encoders in our dataset:

    ```{r}
    # Create function
    encoder_function <- function(df){
      df %>% 
      left_join(gender_encoder) %>% 
      select(-gender) %>% 
      rename(gender = gender_num) %>% 
      left_join(region_encoder) %>% 
      select(-region_code) %>% 
      rename(region_code = region_num) %>% 
      left_join(policy_encoder) %>% 
      select(-policy_sales_channel) %>% 
      rename(policy_sales_channel = policy_num) 
    }
    ```

    ```{r}
    # Save function in rds
    saveRDS(encoder_function, "encoder_function.rds")
    ```

    ## Splitting into train and test datasets

    ```{r}
    encoder_function <- readRDS("encoder_function.rds")

    df_preprocessed <- encoder_function(df_cleaned)
    ```

    ```{r}
    set.seed(123)

    df_split <- df_preprocessed %>% 
      initial_split(prop = 0.75, strata = response)

    df_train <- df_split %>% 
      training()

    df_test <- df_split %>% 
      testing()
    ```

-   Check response proportions:

    ```{r}
    df_train %>% 
      select(response) %>% 
      tbl_summary(type = list(response ~ "categorical"))


    df_test %>% 
      select(response) %>% 
      tbl_summary(type = list(response ~ "categorical"))
    ```

-   Using tidymodels steps to continue the preprocessing:

```{r}
df_recipe <- recipe(response ~.,
       data = df_train) %>% 
  step_normalize(age, days_associated) %>% 
  step_scale(health_annual_paid) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())
```

-   Applying the recipe:

```{r}
# Train the recipe
df_train_prep <- df_recipe %>% 
  prep(training = df_train)

df_train_processed <- df_train_prep %>% 
  bake(new_data = df_train) 
```

```{r}
# For the test dataset 
df_test_processed <- df_train_prep %>% 
  bake(new_data = df_test) 
```

# Feature selection

```{r}
predictors <- df_train_processed %>% 
  select(-id, -response)

target <- df_train_processed$response

# Check raw numbers
length(target)
nrow(predictors) 
```

```{r}
start_time <- Sys.time()

rf_model <- randomForest(predictors, target, ntree = 10,
                         importance = TRUE)

end_time <- Sys.time()

print(end_time - start_time)
```

-   Show results:

```{r}
importance(rf_model) %>% View()
```

```{r}
varImpPlot(rf_model)
```

In this first cycle we are going to select the seven most important variables according to the Mean Decrease Gini:

```{r}
importance(rf_model) %>% 
  as_tibble(rownames = "rowname") %>% 
  arrange(desc(MeanDecreaseGini)) %>% 
  select(rowname) %>% 
  slice(1:7) %>% 
  pull()
```

```{r}
selected_columns <- c(
  "age",
  "vehicle_damage",
  "days_associated",
  "previously_insured",
  "health_annual_paid", 
  "policy_sales_channel",

  "response"
)
```

```{r}
# Final dataset
df_selected <- df_cleaned %>%
